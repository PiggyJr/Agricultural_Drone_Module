This was a project which I started in my Systems Engineering course. The idea behind the project was to design
and fabricate an agricultural drone module which can be deployed to collect data about the agriculatural land.

The project uses an Arduino Uno microcontroller to control all sensors and mechanisms on the drone module.
MATLAB was used to program a GUI which received and recorded data from the module wirelessly using Bluetooth 
in real time.
